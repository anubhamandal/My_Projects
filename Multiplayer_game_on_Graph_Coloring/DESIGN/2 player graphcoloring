vertex coloring
Alice and Bob color the vertices of a graph G with a set k of colors.
Alice and Bob take turns, coloring properly an uncolored vertex (in the standard version, Alice begins).
If a vertex v is impossible to color properly (for any color, v has a neighbor colored with it), then Bob wins.
If the graph is completely colored, then Alice wins.

edge coloring
Alice and Bob are coloring the edges a graph G with a set k of colors.
Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored edge (in the standard version, Alice begins).
If an edge e is impossible to color properly (for any color, e is adjacent to an edge colored with it), then Bob wins.
If the graph is completely edge-colored, then Alice wins.
